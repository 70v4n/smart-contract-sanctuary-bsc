‚ùóÔ∏èOPTIMUS PRIME COIN - FAIR LAUNCH‚ùóÔ∏è

July 17 at 20:00 UTCüöÄ

Let $ OPC Inu send your wallet into space with our radically new token designs that are driving the community crazy.
Our community will send $ OPC Inu to the Moon under the guidance of a large team of hardworking, leading industry professionals.

$ OPC is a community deflationary token that allows holders to make even more money when other people buy or sell. This Fan Token is a trusted and community driven project. It is programmed to reward the holders of our coin. Each transaction will result in a 4% burn and 4% 
goes back to holderst. This will trigger an automatic price level increase and also encourage customers to hold tokens as long as possible. We want you to stay in our project as long as possible!


We will make sure that this token is safe and useful for everyone, with great rewards for our first holders.


Stay with our team and your money will only grow.
