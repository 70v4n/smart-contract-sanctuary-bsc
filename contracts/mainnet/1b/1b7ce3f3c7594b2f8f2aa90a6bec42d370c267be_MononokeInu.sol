What is Mononoke?
Mononoke Inu was birthed from the idea of true community focus.
The team were inspired by the adventure picture we have loved 
Since childhood and the anime crypto trend served as a catalyst for its release.

 

We are awestruck by how well it has taken off and the strength of our community. 
Mononoke Inu embodies the essence of the crypto space that the development 
team has come to love.


We are not here to take part - we are here to take over.

LOCK For 900 Days/3Years

Burning Mechanism

We burn a specific amount of supply on milestones.

Additionally, 5% of the 1% Redistribution tax gets burned with every transaction.
