/*
ProxyAdmin 升级管理合约 (ProxyAdmin.sol) 本程序是标准固定的。
作用：代理合约的管理，用于升级业务合约
这个协议有两个关键引用：
1、代理合约 TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol";
上引用本程序用本地的 import "./TranUpgrProxy.sol"; 代替了。
2、用于管理者的模块：
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
本文中直接写入了。

合约升级：
1、新的业务逻辑合约产生新的地址 NEWADD
2、调用 代理管理的合约地址  ProxyAdmin.sol 的 方法有两个：
upgrade，需要传入proxy地址，新的逻辑实现地址
upgradeAndCall，需要传入roxy地址，新的逻辑实现地址，初始化调用数据(如果要重新初始化数据用这个)

测试网：
调用管理地址：  0x36952604eD7130f030f17186ee0f30eA3d4A1cf1
生成合约地址：  0xd9DA17079305bDC665a4F904A7046652eA54A2cF

升级过程：
调用 代理管理的合约 ProxyAdmin.sol 的 方法：
upgrade，需要传入 proxy 地址，新的逻辑实现地址
proxy = 0x35C76825a99d41af92e9bdc54EE724f995FC2c67  代理合约地址
implementation = 0x58F390b5D4347d57e3F8520aBd6035Cc06437c14  新的逻辑合约地址
