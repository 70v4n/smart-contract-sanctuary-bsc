     * @dev Revokes `role` from the calling account.
     *
     * Roles are often managed via {grantRole} and {revokeRole}: this function's
     * purpose is to provide a mechanism for accounts to lose their privileges
     * if they are compromised (such as when a trusted device is misplaced).
     *
     * If the calling account had been granted `role`, emits a {RoleRevoked}
     * event.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - the caller must be `account`.
