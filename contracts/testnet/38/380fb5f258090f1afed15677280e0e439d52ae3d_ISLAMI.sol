     * @dev Returns the address that signed a hashed message (`hash`) with

     *
     * The `ecrecover` EVM opcode allows for malleable (non-unique) signatures:

     * recover to arbitrary addresses for non-hashed data. A safe way to ensure

 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
